# Aura – The Crisis Clarity Engine

Aura is an AI-powered decision clarity application designed to help people navigate moments of uncertainty. It supports users who feel stuck, confused, or overwhelmed by providing clear explanations and safe next steps instead of long or overwhelming advice.
This project was built and submitted as part of **Microsoft Imagine Cup 2026**.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

In moments of uncertainty—such as career confusion, education pressure, emotional overload, or risky situations—people often struggle to decide what to do next. Panic, stress, and information overload prevent clear thinking, leading to delayed or poor decisions.
Existing solutions like search engines or chatbots either provide too much unstructured information or focus on conversation rather than clarity.


## 💡 Solution

Aura is a decision clarity engine,not a chatbot.

Instead of long conversations, Aura provides **structured guidance** through four clear components:

1. Situation Type – Identifies the kind of uncertainty (e.g., career, education, risk, emotional stress)
2. What’s Going On– Explains the core issue in simple language
3. Recommended Next Step– Suggests a safe, practical action
4. Why This Helps – Builds trust and understanding behind the recommendation

This approach helps users move from confusion to clarity quickly and responsibly.


## ⚙️ How It Works (MVP)

- The user describes their situation in plain text
- Aura analyzes the input using context-based logic
- The system returns structured guidance tailored to the situation

The current MVP uses rule-based reasoning to demonstrate the decision flow.  
In future iterations, **Azure OpenAI** can be integrated to provide deeper semantic understanding and scalable AI reasoning.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Streamlit(frontend + deployment)
- AI / Decision Logic
- Cloud Deployment

## 🌍 Responsible AI & Safety

Aura is designed as a **decision-support tool**, not a replacement for professionals.

- No diagnosis or life-altering decisions
- No user behavior tracking or data storage
- Privacy-first, single-input analysis
- Focuses on safe, incremental next steps
This ensures ethical and responsible AI usage.

## ♿ Diversity & Inclusion

Aura is built with inclusion in mind:

- Simple, clear language
- No technical background required
- Works across different life situations
- Accessible on any device with a browser

The goal is to empower users from diverse backgrounds with clarity, not complexity.


## 📌 Use Cases

- Students confused about education or career choices
- Employees feeling stuck or overwhelmed at work
- Individuals facing emotional or situational stress
- Users encountering potentially risky situations


## 📈 Future Improvements

- Integration with **Azure OpenAI** for advanced reasoning
- Voice-based input using Azure Speech Services
- Multi-language support
- Personalization with strict privacy controls
